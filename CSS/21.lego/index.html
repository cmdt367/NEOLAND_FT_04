            <h3>Imagination</h3>
            <p>
              Free play is how children develop their imagination – the
              foundation for creativity. Curiosity asks WHY and imagines
              possible explanations. Playfulness asks WHAT IF and imagines how
              the ordinary becomes extraordinary, fantasy or fiction. Dreaming
              it is a first step towards doing it.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Creativity</h3>
            <p>
              Creativity is the ability to come up with ideas that are new,
              surprising and valuable - and it’s an essential 21st century
              skill. Systematic creativity is a particular form of creativity
              that combines logic and reasoning with playfulness and
              imagination.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Fun</h3>
            <p>
              Fun is being active together, the thrill of an adventure, the
              joyful enthusiasm of children and the delight in surprising both
              yourself and others in what you can do or create. Fun is the
              happiness we experience when we are fully engaged in something
              that requires mastery, when our abilities are in balance with the
              challenge at hand and we are making progress towards a goal.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Learning</h3>
            <p>
              Learning is about being curious, experimenting and collaborating –
              expanding our thinking and doing, helping us develop new insights
              and new skills. We learn through play by putting things together,
              taking them apart and putting them together in different ways.
              Building, un-building, rebuilding, thereby creating new things and
              developing new ways of thinking about ourselves, and the world.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Caring</h3>
            <p>
              Caring is about our desire to make a positive difference in the
              lives of children, for our colleagues, our partners, and the world
              we live in. Doing that little extra, not because we have to – but
              because it feels right and because we care.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Quality</h3>
            <p>
              For us quality means the challenge of continuous improvement to
              provide the best play material, the best for children and their
              development and the best to our community and partners. From a
              reputation for manufacturing excellence to becoming trusted by all
              – we believe in quality that speaks for itself and earns us the
              recommendation of all.
